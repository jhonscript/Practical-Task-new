Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine

Yeah, you used to call me 'baby'
Now, you're calling me by name

Takes one to know one

Yeah you beat me at my own damn game

You're pushing
You're pushing

I'm pulling away
I'm pulling away from you

I give
I give
I give

And you take
Give and you take

Young blood
Say you want me
Say you want me

Out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight

But you need it
Yeah, you need it
All of the time

Young blood
Say you want me
Say you want me

Back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight

'Cause I need it
Yeah, I need it
All of the time

Lately, our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye

Yeah, one of us gets too drunks and calls about a hundred times

So, who you been calling, baby?
Nobody could take my place

When you looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face
